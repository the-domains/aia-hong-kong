AIA Hong Kong, A Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, was established in 1997 to serve the professional interests of the growing number of AIA member architects practicing in Hong Kong, China and the Asia Pacific region.
The objective of this Chapter is to uphold a high standard of design, education and professional practice among its members as well as to promote the importance of architecture in society.
In addition, AIA Hong Kong helps to foster stronger ties between The American Institute of Architects and other professional architectural organizations in Asia, such as the Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA) and the Architectural Society of China (ASC), among others.
